# Whitelabel

## Overview

The whitelabel partnership offer partners a way to transparently give their existing users access to Celsius Network features. 

## Getting started

1. Partner and Celsius Network become partners
2. Partner receives a partner token that will be used to authenticate that partner on Celsius API
3. Partner creates unique user-tokens for their users which are then used to authenticate them on Celsius API
4. Each request sent to the Celsius API is followed by the partner (authenticating the partner) and user (differentiating between partner's users) token.
