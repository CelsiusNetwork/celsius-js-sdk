- Methods:
  - ```CelsiusInstance.getSupportedCountries(userSecret)``` that returns the list of countries supported by Celsius. 
  - ```CelsiusInstance.health(message)``` checks the health of the server. Kudos to [@andreujuanc](https://github.com/andreujuanc)
  - ```CelsiusInstance.getKycVerificationStatus(userId, userSecret)``` checks the KYC status, similar to existing `getKycStatus` method, but takes also `userId` as a parameter

  - ```CelsiusInstance.startKycVerification(userId, documentType, userDocuments, userSecret)``` starts the KYC verification same as existing `verifyKyc` method, but it doesn't 
   create the user, but rather receives an existing user's id - `userId` as a parameter
